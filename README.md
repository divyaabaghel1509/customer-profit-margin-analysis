Customer Profit Margin Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing profit margins across different customer types: Corporate, Consumer, Small Business, and Home Office. The analysis aims to uncover significant differences in profit margins and provide insights into trends.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, type conversions).

Visualizations of profit margin distributions for each customer type.

Boxplots, histograms, and KDE plots to analyze distribution.

Statistical Testing:

Shapiro-Wilk test to check the normality of profit margins.

Mann-Whitney U Test to compare profit margins between Corporate and Consumer customers, identifying significant differences.

Data Visualizations:

Customized histograms, boxplots, and KDE plots to provide clear insights into the profit margin trends.

Use of Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas for effective data visualization.

Technologies Used
Python

Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy

Statistical Analysis: Shapiro-Wilk Test, Mann-Whitney U Test

Steps Taken
Data Cleaning: Removed missing values and ensured correct data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed and visualized data distributions.

Statistical Testing: Checked normality and performed hypothesis testing.

Visualization: Created meaningful plots to present the findings.

Conclusion
The analysis aims to provide insights into how profit margins differ across customer segments and whether these differences are statistically significant.
