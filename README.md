Customer Profit Margin Analysis 📊💼
Project Overview 🔍
This project explores profit margin trends across various customer types: Corporate, Consumer, Small Business, and Home Office. The objective is to identify significant differences in profit margins, analyze the data distributions, and derive actionable insights for business strategies.

Key Highlights ✨
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data cleaning, missing value handling, and type conversion.

Visualized distributions of profit margins for each customer segment.

Created histograms, boxplots, and KDE plots for deeper insights.

Statistical Testing 🧑‍🔬:

Shapiro-Wilk Test: Checked the normality of profit margin data.

Mann-Whitney U Test: Compared profit margins between Corporate and Consumer customer groups to test for significant differences.

Visualizations 🎨:

Custom histograms and boxplots for each customer segment.

KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plots to show the smooth distribution.

Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas used for clear and interactive visualizations.
Conclusion 📈
The analysis provides insights into customer profit margin trends and helps in identifying segments that may need more attention to improve profitability.
